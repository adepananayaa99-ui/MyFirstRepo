Brief Introduction About Myself
--------------------------------

My name is Gloria Adepa Adu-Twum. I am a passionate learner who enjoys exploring new opportunities and challenges. I love learning new skills, working on creative ideas, and using technology to make a positive difference in the world.

This is my very first repository on GitHub, and I am very excited to start my journey of creating projects, learning about version control, and improving my skills as I grow.
